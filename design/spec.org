- A /note/ is a common music note and its octave (examples: ~A#4~, ~B♭2~, ~Bb2~, ~C♯2~, ~c3~).
- A /rest/ is the literal ~rest~ or a rest symbol.
- A /duration/ is a positive fraction (with a power of two denominator) or integer.
- A /tuplet/ is a positive integer followed by the character ~t~ (example: a triplet is ~3t~).
- A /time-signature/ is a positive fraction (with a power of two denominator).
- A /key-signature/ is a music note.
- A /chord-symbol/ is a symbol.
